Best Time to Visit Maharashtra:
1. Winter (October to Feb): Best for everything. Pleasant weather (15°C-25°C). Ideal for forts, beaches, and caves (Ajanta-Ellora).
2. Monsoon (June to Sept): Best for Western Ghats, waterfalls (Lonavala, Malshej Ghat), and trekking. High humidity on coast.
3. Summer (March to May): Hot and humid (30°C-40°C). Avoid coastal areas. Good for hill stations like Mahabaleshwar and Matheran.
4. Peak Season: Dec-Jan (New Year crowds) and Ganesh Chaturthi (Cultural experience).
